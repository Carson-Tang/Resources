# Resources
Data Structures, Algorithms, Utility Classes

- Java Resources compile in Java 8, Java 11  
- Kotlin Resources compile in Kotlin 1.3  

### Currently being refactored
- 79 character line limit  
- 2 spaces for indentation  
- very compressed coding style to reduce wasted space in pdf, with multiple
statements on a single line  
- `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, etc ... statements should either be immediately
followed by a single statement and a newline, a block wrapped in curly braces
followed by a newline, or only a newline
- otherwise, mostly adhering to
